## Project Purpose
The purpose of Sharp Wallet is to make it where the wallet’s currency is co-owned meaning no single person has absolute power over the currency. An example of this in the real world is a escrow service on the internet where you are trying to buy something expensive from a stranger online and this money is then put into a multi-sig wallet controlled by 3 people, you, seller, and a trusted third party. All parties must then confirm the transaction to prevent scam. But you need a middle man in the real world example, a smart contract enforces the rules automatically so no middle man is needed.
